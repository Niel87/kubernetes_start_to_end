   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kubernetes-zero-to-hero
   ```

2. **Install Required Tools**:
   - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): Command-line tool for Kubernetes

### Example: Creating a Deployment

#### YAML File: `nginx-deployment.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### Commands:
```bash
# Apply the manifest
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

# Check the Deployment and Pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods

# View logs from one of the Pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
